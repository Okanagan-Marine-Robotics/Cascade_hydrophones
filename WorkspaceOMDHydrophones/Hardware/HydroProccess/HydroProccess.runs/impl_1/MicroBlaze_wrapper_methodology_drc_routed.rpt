Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock clk1Mhz is created on an inappropriate pin MicroBlaze_i/clk1Mhz_0/inst/clk1Mhz_BUFG_inst/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
