Multiple clocks are user generated or auto-derived on the source pin MicroBlaze_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/mmcm_adv_inst/CLKOUT0 but are not logically or physically exclusive with respect to one another. To have the static timing analysis match the behavior in hardware, there cannot be multiple clocks generated on the same pin and when such situation occurs, the clocks should be defined as physically or logically exclusive. The list of clocks generated on the source pin is: clk_out1_MicroBlaze_clk_wiz_0_0, clk_out1_MicroBlaze_clk_wiz_0_0_1
