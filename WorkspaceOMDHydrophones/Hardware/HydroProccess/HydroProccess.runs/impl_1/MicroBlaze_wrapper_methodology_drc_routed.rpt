There is a large setup violation of -3.190 ns between MicroBlaze_i/CC_0/inst/count_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and MicroBlaze_i/AddressFixer_0/inst/address_reg[7]/R (clocked by clk_fpga_0). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
