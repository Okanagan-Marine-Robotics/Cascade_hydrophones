TIMING-2#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock clk1Mhz is created on an inappropriate pin MicroBlaze_i/clk1Mhz_0/inst/clk1Mhz_BUFG_inst/O. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree

There is a large setup violation of -2.562 ns between MicroBlaze_i/axi_gpio_1/U0/gpio_core_1/Dual.gpio_Data_Out_reg[28]/C (clocked by clk_fpga_0) and MicroBlaze_i/SineWaveGen_1/inst/wave_reg[7]/R (clocked by clk1Mhz). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
